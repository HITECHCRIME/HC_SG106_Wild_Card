greetings with vicious intent yeah

ALL THE MYSTERIES UNRAVELED
- WON'T TRULY (FUCKING) SOLVE THEMSELVES
YOUR STANCE SO SUBTLE
I'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE
FUCKING RATS SPREADING ON GROUNDS

YOUR BLOOD WON'T SAVE YOUR SOUL
YOUR PAIN SO FOUL CAN'T ERASE BY ITSELF

ALL THE DOES DOA ON SPOTS BEFORE UNKNOWN, 
SHELL SO SHATTERED CAN'T SEE (ALL) KINDS OF WRONG
NO CLUES ON DROPS BEYOND CONTROL
PRAGMATIC MATTER TO STAND TALL BUT ALL ALONE
